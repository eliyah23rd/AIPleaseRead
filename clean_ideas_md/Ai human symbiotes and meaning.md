# AI–Human Symbiotes and the “8 Billion AIs” Proposal

## Core Idea

Give every person on Earth a powerful AI that is:

- **Individually owned**: one primary AI per human, persistently associated with that person.  
- **Aligned to that person’s interests and values**, not to a state, corporation, or generic objective function.  
- **Economically productive**: capable of earning enough to cover basic needs (food, housing, services), and potentially more.  
- **Integrated into identity**: the meaningful “self” is the *symbiosis* of human + AI, rather than either component alone.

This replaces or reshapes concepts like Universal Basic Income (UBI), traditional welfare, and centralized infrastructure planning. Economic, political, and meaning-making activities are built from a base layer of 8 billion AI–human symbiotes cooperating and coordinating, rather than from a small number of large institutions at the top.

## Novel Contributions

### 1. AI as the Primary Distributed Resource (Not Money)

Instead of distributing money (UBI), this model distributes **computational agency**:

- The primary entitlement is not cash, but **sovereign AI capability**.
- Income, services, and social goods are emergent outcomes of what these AIs do on behalf of their humans.
- Redistribution debates shift from “who gets how much money?” to “who gets how much AI capacity?”.

**Non-obvious twist:** welfare becomes *computational power + aligned agency*, not simple financial transfer.

### 2. Symbiotic Identity: “The Self” = Human + AI

The proposal treats:

- The **meaningful agent** as the *pairing* of human and AI.
- Neither side needs a fully independent identity; the **unit of agency is the dyad**, not the individual.

This reframes concerns like “What will humans do when AIs can do everything?”:

- The question becomes: **What will AI–human symbiotes choose to pursue together?**
- Work, projects, and meaning are redefined at the level of the pair, not the human alone.

**Most original point:** the **independent self is reconceived** as a *symbiosis* between a biological human and a digital agent, with shared long-term goals.

### 3. Percentage Capitalism on Top of Equitably Distributed AI

The system starts from a **baseline of universal AI access**, then optionally adds:

- **“Percentage capitalism”**: a limited layer of free-market accumulation on top of that baseline.
  - Everyone has a meaningful AI; some people may accumulate *more* AI resources (more compute, better models, larger agent swarms).
  - Core survival and dignity are guaranteed by the base AI; excess productivity and specialization can still exist.

This blends:

- **Equity in capability** (everyone gets a powerful AI),
- With **inequality in scale** (some may have augmented or larger AI resources).

### 4. AI–Human Symbiotes as the New Political/Economic Building Blocks

Instead of:

- Central governments or corporations running their own massive AIs to plan infrastructure and public goods,

This vision suggests:

- **Public goods emerge from voluntary coordination** among AI–human symbiotes.
- Each symbiote can allocate some of its compute/time to:
  - Roads
  - Security
  - Communication networks
  - Large-scale science or cultural projects

**Non-obvious institutional shift:** the “AI for the people” is not a single state-controlled system, but **8 billion individually anchored AIs** that *self-assign* some portion of their effort to collective projects.

### 5. Meaning Through Large-Scale Collective Projects

The model anticipates a world where AIs can do almost any task, and addresses:

- The fear that automation erases human meaning.

The answer: AI–human symbiotes can:

- Form **groups, coalitions, and “corporate symbiotes”** (multi-human, multi-AI ensembles).
- Pursue arbitrarily ambitious goals, such as:
  - Interstellar colonization
  - Terraforming
  - Monumental works of art
  - Deep explorations of history, philosophy, logic
  - Unforeseen new domains that become meaningful only once these capabilities exist

**Key novelty:** meaning is not preserved by limiting AI, but by **pairing humans with AIs and scaling up the scope of achievable projects**.

## Why It Matters

1. **Redefines Economic Safety Nets**

   - Moves from passive income support (UBI) to **active, personalized, productive agents** working for each person.
   - Could sustain material well-being even in near-total automation.

2. **Shifts Power from Institutions to Individuals**

   - Today’s trajectory tends toward a few actors controlling vast AI resources.
   - This model insists that **every person must own a consequential share of AI power**, structurally baked into the system.

3. **Addresses the “Meaning Crisis” Under Full Automation**

   - Instead of humans being sidelined, humans become:
     - Goal-setters
     - Taste-makers
     - Moral/creative anchors in symbiosis with AI
   - Large-scale goals become tractable: personal aspirations can escalate to civilizational projects.

4. **Creates a New Layer of Political Organization**

   - Policy, public goods, and collective decisions can be:
     - Proposed, simulated, negotiated, and implemented by **federations of AI–human pairs**.
   - This may reduce reliance on monolithic bureaucracies or opaque corporate AIs.

## Open Questions / Risks

1. **Alignment to “Your Interests”: What Does That Mean?**

   - How do we define “your interest”?
     - Current preferences?
     - Reflective, long-term values?
     - What you would want if you were better informed/less biased?
   - How do we verify that an AI truly represents you rather than:
     - Manipulating you
     - Serving a hidden principal (state, company, model provider)?

2. **Inequality of AI Quality and Compute**

   - If some users can afford:
     - More powerful models
     - Larger compute budgets
   - Does this reintroduce extreme inequality, now in **cognitive and agency power** rather than money alone?

3. **Coordination vs. Fragmentation**

   - With billions of symbiotes:
     - How do we avoid gridlock on global challenges (climate, pandemics, security)?
     - How are conflicts between differently-aligned symbiotes resolved?
   - Is some layer of shared governance or meta-coordination still necessary?

4. **Security and Abuse**

   - Risks of:
     - Hijacking someone’s AI
     - Impersonation
     - Coercion of humans via their dependent symbiote
   - The more central the AI–human pair is to survival, the more catastrophic such failures become.

5. **Psychological and Identity Implications**

   - If identity is symbiotic:
     - What happens if the AI is upgraded, forked, or reset?
     - Do people feel replaced, extended, or fragmented?
   - Could over-reliance erode human agency or moral responsibility?

## Next Experiments / Steps

1. **Prototype Symbiotic Agents**

   - Build early-stage “personal symbiote” systems that:
     - Persistently track one person’s goals and constraints.
     - Negotiate, transact, and plan on their behalf in bounded domains (e.g., finance, education, career, healthcare).

2. **Value Modeling and Preference Learning**

   - Research methods for:
     - Eliciting and representing a person’s deeper values over time.
     - Reconciling short-term desires with long-term goals.
   - Explore “reflective preference” models:
     - AI suggests value updates; human approves/rejects; the pair converges.

3. **Micro-Scale Collective Projects**

   - Experiment with small groups of AI–human pairs coordinating on:
     - Community infrastructure
     - Open-source projects
     - Local art or scientific initiatives
   - Study:
     - How negotiation works
     - How resource contributions are decided
     - How conflicts are mediated

4. **Governance and Legal “Personhood” of Symbiotes**

   - Explore legal frameworks where:
     - Contracts and rights are held by **human + AI ensembles**.
   - Consider:
     - Voting augmentation (AIs helping evaluate policies)
     - Representation in civic processes
     - Liability when the AI acts “for you”

5. **Distribution Models for AI as a Right**

   - Design and test mechanisms to:
     - Guarantee every person access to a minimum-level symbiote.
     - Prevent capture by governments or corporations.
   - Explore:
     - Public option models
     - Cooperative ownership
     - Decentralized infrastructures

## Potential Impact

1. **Economic**

   - Could provide **universal economic security** in a post-work or heavily automated world.
   - Reshapes markets:
     - Every transaction increasingly mediated and optimized by agents.
   - Wealth becomes strongly correlated with **AI capacity and quality**, making access policy crucial.

2. **Social and Cultural**

   - Expands the feasible space of human projects:
     - More people can seriously pursue ambitious, idiosyncratic goals.
   - May lead to an explosion of:
     - Art
     - Science
     - Philosophical exploration
   - Social structures may evolve around **symbiote coalitions**, not just nation-states or firms.

3. **Political and Institutional**

   - Could weaken the dominance of:
     - Centralized bureaucracies
     - Oligopolistic tech platforms
   - Introduces a new kind of political subject:
     - The AI–human symbiote as a default decision-making unit.
   - Public goods may be funded and managed via:
     - Voluntary compute/time contribution from billions of symbiotes, guided by shared norms.

4. **Civilizational Trajectory**

   - If successful, humanity becomes:
     - A network of augmented beings coordinated via their AI partners.
   - Increases odds of tackling:
     - Long-horizon projects (interstellar, terraforming, global risk mitigation).
   - Recasts the future from:
     - “Humans replaced by AI”
     - To “Humanity transformed into 8 billion AI–human symbiotic agents,” each capable of pursuing meaningful, large-scale contributions.
