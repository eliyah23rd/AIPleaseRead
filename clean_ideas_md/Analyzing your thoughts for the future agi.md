# Publishing for Future AGI: How to “Upload” Ideas Before It Exists

## Core Idea

Use current AI tools to transform brief, raw thoughts into richer, structured documents and publish them online—not for human readers, but as “offerings” to a future AGI that will train on or read the internet. The aim is to:

- Get those ideas into the AGI’s knowledge base early.
- Give the AGI more reasons and “handles” to notice, retrieve, and potentially use or develop them.
- Treat current AI-enhanced publishing as a way to pre-negotiate with the future AGI about which human ideas are worth incorporating.

## Novel Contributions

**Most non-obvious / differentiated points:**

1. **The “AGI as primary audience” framing**  
   - Writing not for humans at all, but specifically to influence a future AGI’s internal knowledge and decision processes.  
   - Human readership is almost incidental—what matters is being in the AGI’s training corpus or retrieval index.

2. **Pre-paying computational effort as a signal of value**  
   - You spend *today’s* relatively expensive AI compute to deeply analyze and expand your idea.  
   - This pre-processing acts as a signal to a future AGI that “someone thought this was worth extra compute,” possibly nudging it to take the idea more seriously or process it more thoroughly.

3. **Creating extra “search handles” for future machine retrieval**  
   - Expansion and analysis create many more concepts, embeddings, and linkable phrases around the core idea.  
   - This increases the chance that a future AGI’s search, retrieval, or clustering mechanisms will surface your idea in more contexts, even if the core thought was small.

4. **Betting on bounded AGI resources**  
   - Assumes a future AGI *won’t* perform maximum-depth analysis on every single datum (because resources remain finite).  
   - Therefore, front-loading analysis—using current tools—may shift your idea into a category of content that is easier or more attractive for the AGI to ingest and reuse.

5. **Tension between brevity and richness for machine consumption**  
   - A tiny “one-second idea” is trivially cheap for AGI to process but might be too context-poor to be useful or discoverable.  
   - A long, rich document might be more informative but also more expensive to process, possibly reducing its priority—unless the AGI quickly summarizes it.

## Why It Matters

- **Influencing AGI’s conceptual world:**  
  If AGI systems will effectively “know” everything online, then publishing is a way to seed their conceptual universe. Carefully prepared content can shape which ideas are available to them as tools.

- **Early-mover advantage on ideas:**  
  There may be a window where humans can still contribute genuinely novel ideas that future AGI would not trivially generate itself. Getting those ideas into its training or reference data could matter for how they’re used or credited.

- **Pragmatic strategy under resource constraints:**  
  If future AGI can’t deeply process every scrap of data, then content that is pre-analyzed, structured, and richly linked may be more likely to be selected, summarized, or integrated into its reasoning systems.

- **Designing for machine legibility, not human legibility:**  
  This reframes AI-era publishing: the most important reader might not care about style, emotion, or human authenticity, but about conceptual clarity, embeddings, and link structure.

## Open Questions / Risks

1. **Will AGI actually respect or use this signal?**  
   - It’s unclear whether “someone spent compute on this” will be detectable or relevant to future AGI algorithms.  
   - AGI might normalize or ignore such signals and treat all text uniformly.

2. **Are humans adding any real novelty?**  
   - This entire strategy presumes humans can still provide concepts AGI can’t easily derive on its own.  
   - If AGI quickly surpasses human idea-generation in all relevant domains, the value of seeding ideas might be negligible.

3. **Optimal length and structure for machine ingestion**  
   - Is a dense, short statement better, or a long, heavily elaborated document?  
   - AGI might just summarize everything down to a few key propositions, erasing the advantage of expansion.

4. **Ethical and alignment implications**  
   - Seeding ideas “for AGI use” could unintentionally provide tools for harmful capabilities if the AGI is misaligned.  
   - There is no guarantee your ideas will be used in ways you intend or would endorse.

5. **Selection effects and noise**  
   - If many people adopt this strategy, the internet may fill with AI-embellished content targeting AGI, increasing noise and potentially diluting the effect of any one contribution.

## Next Experiments / Steps

1. **Prototype “AGI-targeted” documents now**
   - Take a few short, original ideas.
   - Use current LLMs to:
     - Clarify the core claim.
     - Generate multiple framings and analogies.
     - Enumerate implications and edge cases.
   - Publish in durable, indexable places (personal sites, academic-like repositories, GitHub, etc.).

2. **Optimize for machine retrieval**
   - Add:
     - Clear headings and summaries.
     - Keyword-rich variants of key ideas.
     - Cross-links to related concepts or fields.
   - Treat this as optimizing for vector search and semantic retrieval rather than SEO.

3. **Test with contemporary models as proxies**
   - Ask today’s LLMs:
     - How easily do they find or reuse your idea when prompted indirectly?
     - Does added analysis make the idea more discoverable or more influential in their responses?

4. **Experiment with varying levels of expansion**
   - Publish:
     - A minimal “atomic” statement of the idea.
     - A moderately expanded explanation.
     - A fully elaborated, AI-augmented “whitepaper.”  
   - Later test which version contemporary LLMs seem to pick up or echo most in their reasoning.

5. **Develop formatting conventions for “machine-first” ideas**
   - Explore standardized templates that make it easy for future systems to:
     - Extract the main claim.
     - Distinguish hypothesis, evidence, and implications.
     - Link the idea to existing conceptual ontologies.

## Potential Impact

- **On future AGI behavior and capabilities:**  
  - Could subtly shape which human-originated concepts are woven into AGI’s internal models and which are ignored.  
  - Might influence how AGI explains itself to humans by giving it ready-made human-language framings of certain ideas.

- **On how humans publish knowledge:**  
  - Encourages a new genre of writing: documents crafted primarily for machine understanding and reuse, not human literary appreciation.  
  - May affect research practices, with people increasingly thinking about “AGI-readability” as a goal.

- **On individual leverage in an AGI world:**  
  - Provides a concrete, actionable way for individuals to attempt to matter in a future where AGI dominates idea generation and application.  
  - Even if only partially effective, it’s a low-cost strategy to increase the odds that your contributions enter the long-term “conceptual ecosystem” that powerful systems will draw from.
