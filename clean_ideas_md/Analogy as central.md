# Analogy as the Engine of Thought

## Core Idea

All thinking depends on analogy.

Not just poetic metaphor, but the very possibility of learning, generalizing, and reasoning relies on analogical structure. We never deal with identical situations twice; we only ever recognize “sameness” by treating different things *as if* they were the same in relevant ways. That “as if” operation is analogy.

Two core claims:

1. **Learning requires analogy**  
   - We accumulate many messy, unique experiences.  
   - From these, we extract patterns—guiding insights that have predictive power.  
   - To apply those insights, we must treat new situations as analogous to old ones, even though they are never truly identical.

2. **Reasoning and certainty require analogy**  
   - What we treat as “certain” or “axiomatic” are simplified, cartoon-like statements about the world.  
   - These simplified statements compress complex reality into short, graspable forms that fit within our cognitive limits.  
   - That simplification is itself an analogical move: we map a rich, detailed situation onto a crude model and then reason *as if* the model were the situation.

Together, these suggest that analogy is not just one tool among many; it is the structural necessity that underlies both learning from experience and building logical systems.

## Novel Contributions

### 1. Analogy as the Glue of Repetition

**Non-obvious point:** Analogy is what makes *repetition itself* possible as a concept.

- We say we “did the same task 100 times,” but strictly speaking, no two episodes are identical:
  - Time has passed, conditions have changed, we have changed.
- To call these episodes “the same,” we *actively construct* a similarity class:
  - We decide which differences to ignore and which features to treat as equivalent.
- That act of grouping is analogical: we treat “iteration 1” and “iteration 57” as analogous events within a single conceptual type.

So analogy is not just moving insight from one domain to another; it is what allows us to call two moments in the *same* domain “the same kind of thing” at all.

### 2. Axioms as Analogical Cartoons

**Non-obvious point:** Even our “basic certainties” and logical axioms are analogical simplifications.

- We rely on short, easily held statements like “there is a tree in front of me” or “objects persist over time.”
- These are not neutral descriptions; they are **cartoons**:
  - They strip away massive amounts of detail.
  - They compress a swirling, high-dimensional sensory and contextual reality into a simple, stable proposition.
- The cognitive constraint (limited working memory, attention) *forces* us into these cartoons.
- Each cartoon is an analogical model: the rich situation is treated *as if* it were that simple statement.

Thus, logic does not stand apart from analogy. It is built on analogically-constructed starting points.

### 3. Analogy as Inescapable, Not Optional

**Differentiated stance:** Rather than treating metaphor/analogy as something we can use more or less of, this view claims:

- We cannot get “outside” analogy to a purely literal, non-analogical mode of thought.
- Even attempts at maximum precision (e.g., formal systems) rest on:
  - Chosen primitives (symbols, axioms) that are analogical stand-ins for aspects of reality.
  - Commitments about which differences to ignore and which to encode.

On this view, “literal” thinking is simply *highly standardized analogy* within a given linguistic or formal system.

## Why It Matters

1. **Reframes debates about metaphor and clarity**  
   If all thinking is analogical at root, then:
   - The issue is not “metaphor vs precision,” but **which analogies we choose and how explicit we are about them**.
   - Critiques of metaphor as misleading must confront the fact that “non-metaphorical” statements are also analogical compressions.

2. **Connects learning theory and epistemology**  
   - From a reinforcement learning perspective, we:
     - Experience many episodes.
     - Learn patterns that help predict outcomes.
   - Epistemologically, we call these patterns “knowledge” or “insight” only by:
     - Asserting analogies between past episodes and new ones.
   - This links the mechanics of learning with the structure of “being certain” about anything.

3. **Highlights the role of cognitive limits in what we call truth**  
   - Because our “certainty modules” can only handle simple propositions:
     - Our foundational beliefs must be cartoons.
   - What we treat as “self-evident truths” is constrained not only by reality, but by what we can fit into attention and working memory.
   - This suggests that **epistemic foundations are partly shaped by cognitive architecture**, not just by correspondence to the world.

## Open Questions / Risks

1. **Is *all* thought analogical, or just most of it?**  
   - Are there any forms of direct, non-analogical awareness (e.g., raw sensations, some forms of immediate experiential “given”)?  
   - Or is even “I feel pain now” already an analogical categorization of many micro-events?

2. **Risk of overgeneralization**  
   - Labeling every simplification as “analogy” might dilute the concept:
     - Is compressing detail always analogical?
     - Or do we need a stricter criterion (e.g., explicit mapping between source and target structures)?

3. **Status of formal systems**  
   - Formal logic and math seem non-metaphorical in their internal operations.
   - Are they:
     - Purely syntactic games (with analogy only at the interpretation interface)?  
     - Or analogical through-and-through (e.g., the choice of primitives and axioms is already analogical modeling)?

4. **Normativity: better vs worse analogies**  
   - If analogy is inevitable, how do we:
     - Distinguish good from bad foundational analogies?
     - Evaluate when a cartoon is an acceptable model vs dangerously misleading?

## Next Experiments / Steps

1. **Clarify a taxonomy of analogy in thought**
   - Distinguish:
     - Cross-domain analogy (classic metaphor).
     - Within-domain analogy (treating different episodes as the same kind).
     - Foundational analogy (cartoon axioms modeling rich reality).
   - Map typical reasoning processes into this taxonomy and see if any step escapes analogy.

2. **Cognitive constraints analysis**
   - Model how working memory and attention limits force:
     - Simplification into short propositions.
     - Selection of which features become “axiomatic.”
   - Explore whether changing cognitive constraints (e.g., with tools or external memory) changes the analogies we rely on.

3. **Case studies of “literal” discourse**
   - Analyze highly technical or “literalist” texts (mathematics, legal code, scientific papers) and:
     - Make explicit the underlying analogies and cartoons.
     - Test whether any segment can be understood without analogical framing.

4. **Normative criteria for good analogical foundations**
   - Propose criteria such as:
     - Predictive robustness across many contexts.
     - Transparent declaration of what is being ignored.
     - Ease of refinement when it fails.
   - Apply these to common foundational propositions in science and everyday cognition.

## Potential Impact

1. **Philosophy of language and metaphor**  
   - Shifts focus from “when we should or shouldn’t use metaphor” to:
     - How metaphors and analogies unconsciously structure all categories and truths.
   - Encourages more honest, explicit treatment of the analogical scaffolding behind “literal” claims.

2. **Epistemology and philosophy of science**  
   - Recasts theories, models, and even observations as structured analogies:
     - Measurements as analogical bridges between instrument states and world states.
     - Laws as stable analogies across time and space.
   - Could refine how we think about model choice, theory change, and underdetermination.

3. **Cognitive science and AI**  
   - Suggests that any system claiming to “reason” or “generalize” must implement some form of analogy:
     - From training data episodes to new instances.
     - From internal representations to simplified decision rules.
   - Offers a conceptual link between reinforcement learning, concept formation, and analogical reasoning.

4. **Everyday reasoning and discourse**  
   - By recognizing that our “obvious” certainties are analogical cartoons, we:
     - Become more cautious about overextending them.
     - Gain tools to reframe disagreements as conflicts between underlying analogies, not just “facts vs errors.”

If pursued further, this line of thought reframes analogy from a stylistic flourish to the deep, unavoidable engine of learning, certainty, and reasoning itself.
