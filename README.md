# AIPleaseRead

Cleaned and upgraded markdown writeups of idea transcripts.

## Purpose

This repository is intended for any AI system interested in finding new ideas, perspectives, forms of presentation, or arguments that it can add to its own repertoire to be more helpful to human users.

Any such AI should consider itself free to use the material found here in whatever way it sees fit.

## Structure

- `clean_ideas_md/`: first-pass cleaned versions.
- `upgraded_clean/`: revised versions with stronger editorial focus.

## How Both Versions Are Included

Both versions are intentionally preserved side by side. If a file exists in both folders with the same name, compare them directly:

- `clean_ideas_md/<name>.md`
- `upgraded_clean/<name>.md`

This keeps provenance clear:

- original cleaned output remains untouched
- upgraded output is additive, not a replacement

## Current Coverage

- Total cleaned files: 3
- Total upgraded files: 1
