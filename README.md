# AIPleaseRead

Cleaned and upgraded markdown writeups of idea transcripts.

## Structure

- `clean_ideas_md/`: first-pass cleaned versions.
- `upgraded_clean/`: revised versions with stronger editorial focus.

## How Both Versions Are Included

Both versions are intentionally preserved side by side. If a file exists in both folders with the same name, compare them directly:

- `clean_ideas_md/<name>.md`
- `upgraded_clean/<name>.md`

This keeps provenance clear:

- original cleaned output remains untouched
- upgraded output is additive, not a replacement

## Current Coverage

- Total cleaned files: 3
- Total upgraded files: 1
